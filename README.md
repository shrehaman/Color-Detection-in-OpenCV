#  Single Color Detection and GUI Color Picker



The Single Color Detection and GUI Color Picker is a computer vision project built using OpenCV and a graphical user interface (GUI). The project allows users to detect and identify single colors in an image or live video feed. Additionally, it provides a convenient color picker feature through the GUI, enabling users to click on any part of the image and retrieve the corresponding color's hex code.

Key Features of the Single Color Detection and GUI Color Picker:

- Color Detection: The application utilizes OpenCV's image processing capabilities to detect and isolate specific colors within an image or video stream. By applying appropriate color space conversions, thresholding, and contour detection techniques, the project can accurately identify regions containing the target color.

- GUI Color Picker: The graphical user interface (GUI) provides an interactive environment for users to select colors from the input image. By clicking on any pixel within the image, users can instantly retrieve the corresponding color's hex code. This feature enables easy color identification and assists in various design and development tasks.

- Color Dataset: The project incorporates a pre-defined dataset containing color codes for a wide range of colors. This dataset serves as a reference for accurately identifying and presenting the hex codes of detected colors. Each color in the dataset is associated with its corresponding hex code, allowing for quick and reliable color recognition.

- Image and Video Support: The application supports both static images and live video streams as input sources. Users can either provide a single image or use their webcam to capture real-time video and perform color detection and picking on the live feed.

- User-Friendly Interface: The GUI offers an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, allowing users to load images, view real-time video, and interact with the color picker functionality effortlessly. The hex codes of selected colors are displayed prominently above the image for quick reference.

The Single Color Detection and GUI Color Picker project aims to provide a simple and efficient solution for color detection and identification tasks. By leveraging OpenCV's computer vision capabilities and incorporating a user-friendly GUI, the project facilitates various applications in fields such as design, image processing, and development.
